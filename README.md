# Giphs Against Humanity
Giphs For Humanity is a multiplayer web application game similar to Apples to Apples or Cards Against Humanity. Users will join a game - 4 to 5 players - using a unique access code (similar to Kahoot) which will add them to a room. Each player will receive x random giphs in which they will choose one giph to submit to the judge. Players select giphs based on a text prompt (ie. crazy cats) and win the prompt card if the judge chooses their giph. The game ends when a player collects x many prompt cards. Giphs passed out to each player each round are based on giphs received from searching Giphyâ€™s api with the text prompt or randomized.
