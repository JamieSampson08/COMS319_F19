## Project Name: Giphs Against Humanity
Giphs For Humanity is a multiplayer web application game similar to Apples to Apples or Cards Against Humanity. Users will join a game of 5 players using a unique access code (similar to Kahoot) which will add them to a room. Each player will receive 5 random giphs in which they will choose one giph to submit to the judge. Players select giphs based on a text prompt (ie. crazy cats) and win the prompt card if the judge chooses their giph. The winner is decided by the max number of rounds won after 10 rounds. Giphs passed out to each player each round are based on giphs received from searching Giphyâ€™s api with the randomized endpoint.
